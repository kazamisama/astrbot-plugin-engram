"""SessionAggregator: v1.6 optional per-speaker conversation buffering.

Why: ObserveHandler feeds every inbound message straight to
MemoryService.observe(), which encodes + stores one engram per message.
Two problems with that for chat:
  1. Noise / fragmentation - every short line becomes its own memory.
  2. Cross-speaker merges - the separator merges by vector similarity
     over a session's candidates without looking at actor_id, so two
     different people saying similar things in a group can collapse into
     one engram, losing the speaker boundary.

This buffer fixes both by aggregating *per (channel_id, actor_id)*:
consecutive messages from the same speaker in the same channel are held
in a small buffer and flushed as ONE combined observation. Because the
buffer key includes actor_id, different speakers never share a buffer,
so cross-speaker merges cannot happen at this layer.

Design constraints (kept deliberately small):
  - No background threads. Flushing is message-driven: every feed()
    first settles any other buffers that have gone idle, then appends to
    the caller's own buffer and flushes it if it hit the size cap.
  - Off by default. When disabled the caller bypasses this entirely and
    keeps the legacy one-engram-per-message behaviour.
  - A lightweight quality gate drops empty / too-short / exact-duplicate
    lines before they ever reach the buffer.

The aggregator does NOT store anything itself; it calls a `sink`
callable (normally MemoryService.observe) with the merged meta dict.
