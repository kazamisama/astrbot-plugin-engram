# Changelog

## [1.64.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- `/mem debug <query>` command: dual-route retriever diagnostic report showing route
  distribution (document/graph/spread), per-engram RRF breakdown, MMR-cut candidates,
  and summary counts.  Warms up the underlying `DualRouteRetriever.explain()` which was
  previously only used in smoke tests.
- `handlers.format.format_debug()`: ~120-line renderer with four sections (route dist,
  top-k detail, candidates cut, summary).  i18n-ready via `t()` calls backed by new
  `debug.*` keys in zh.json / en.json (18 keys + `/mem debug` help line).

### Fixed
- `DualRouteRetriever.explain()` previously only fused `document + graph` routes while
  `search()` additionally fused `spread`.  This caused the diagnostic to silently
  under-report hits when spread contributed.  Now both methods use the same routes
  tuple construction (B14 invariant: every `search()` top-k must have an `explain()`
  attribution).

### Changed
- Version bump: 1.63.0 → 1.64.0 (`hippocampus/__init__.py` + `metadata.yaml`).
- `metadata.yaml` description condensed to v1.64 feature set.
- ROADMAP: B14 marked shipped; B11/B12/B13 marked deferred with rationale.
- `handlers/__init__.py`: `format_debug` re-exported alongside other format functions.

### Smoke
- `tests/_smoke_v68.py`: 9 tests covering explain() route enumeration, format_debug
  0-hit / normal / small-k paths, explain-search alignment invariant, CommandRouter
  registration, and handlers-package re-export.  All pass alongside v65/v66 (no
  regression).
